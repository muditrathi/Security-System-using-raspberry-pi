# Security-System-using-raspberry-pi
A security system made using Raspberry Pi and various sensors which include Ultrasonic Sensor, PIR Sensor and LDR Sensor. 

To raise an alarm, a buzzer is integrated along with a LED. 
Make the pin connections as mentioned in the code. After the connection is done, run the code. After the code is executed, ultrasonic sensor will detect the distance of the 
intruder and print it on the screen. If the distance is less than 50, LDR sensor will check for the darkness, if light is detected, LED will blink and it will print Intruder Detected.
A buzzer is connected in parallel with LED so whenever LED will blink, the buzzer will make sound thus alarming the owner.
